### Homework Submission

-   Late submissions will not be counted and will be issued as unsubmitted.

-   You must maintain at least a **C** homework grade average in order to graduate from the course.

-   A **README** must accompany **ALL** homework assignments. The README must at minimum describe the project and the technologies used. **Homework submitted with an unsatisfactory README will be issued an incomplete**.

Please see the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for guidance on Markdown syntax.

### Incomplete Homework Submission

If you submit a link to an **empty repository** on the due date, we'll count it as unsubmitted and mark it as Incomplete.

If your work in a linked repository **shows little to no effort**, we'll count it as unsubmitted and mark it as an F.

If you receive an Incomplete for work **very close to completion** with only a minimal fix required, you have up to **one week to make corrections and re-submit**.

If you do not make corrections and resubmit an **Incomplete** assignment within one week, we will grade it as is.

It's YOUR responsibility to address any outstanding issues with your homework assignments and notify the grading TA of an updated submission.
