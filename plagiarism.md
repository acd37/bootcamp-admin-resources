## Plagiarism

[Back to Course Guidelines](/../../)

We want you to get the most out of your Coding Bootcamp. It is imperative that you put your best individual effort into all course deliverables. This includes assignments, activities, projects, and any additional submissions. In the end, these will be utilized to showcase your own work and capabilities as you enter the job search.

We do understand that periodically life happens or a certain topic is more difficult, however, you must push through these challenges and submit your own work. Not only is it important ethically, but also to ensure you are learning the material, mastering each topic, and keeping pace with the class.

### Support

We are here to support you! If you are struggling, inform your instructor. TAs and/or SSM as soon as possible. We will work with you to get you back on track. Attend office hours, sign up for tutoring, join a study group, and work with your team! You can always reach out to your SSM for additional support.

### Tutoring

You can request tutoring by going to the Support tab in the upper right hand side of BCS. When you click Support, a form will come up, and there is a specific question category for "Tutor Requests". To avoid any delay, be sure to include your GitHub username, and any topics you'd like to cover with your tutor, in the "What can we help you with?" section of the form.

### What is Plagiarism in the Coding Industry?

The best part about GitHub and Web Development itself is that it is open source. Developers share their discoveries and new practices which are commonly adopted by others. Stack Overflow is an amazing resource to post issues and questions and have another developer send you corrected code with explanation on where the problem took place.

Plagiarism is taking another individuals code and portraying it as your own. Stealing someone’s repository, and or copying and pasting entire repositories, or even large snippets of code without stemming from your own is also plagiarism.

Examples of plagiarism:

> Copying and pasting entire application code

> Code matches another developer’s solution to coding challenge in exact or almost exact manner

> Copying front-end design exactly with minimal changes

> Re-using partial code, but not changing variables, comments, and structure to match individual application

> Re-using smaller code snippets is not plagiarism.

### Plagiarism vs. Collaboration

You Can ...

1. Use code **snippets** from places like StackOverflow or GitHub
2. Get help from others, especially other students

... if you meet the following conditions:

a) You can understand the code

b) The author of the code allows you to use that code openly and...

c) You cite the source as a comment for your instructional staff to review for approval.\*

`*` Note: The use of other's code is not encouraged. This should be a strategy implemented as a way to maintain engament and momentum in your coding practice. Pleae review the additional notes listed below:

#### Follow These Simple Rules

1. Pseudocode Together / Map Out a Plan of Attack in Non-Code Terms

    > Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm. It is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. Pseudocode typically omits details that are essential for machine understanding of the algorithm, such as variable declarations, system-specific code and some subroutines.

2. Type Every Line of Code Yourself

    > It is our expectation that you have typed every line of code. If asked, you are expected to be able to articulate the reasoning, benefits, drawbacks, experimentation failures, and successes to the choices you made and they way you expressed those choices in code.

    > When experimenting with examples posted online be sure to utilize it as a tool for learning not as a simple fix to the issue. You should attempt to understand the example in context, understand the example as it may apply to your situation, digest the take-aways, and then apply those lessons to your needs.

3) Code in a Cleanroom

    > Writing in a cleanroom is a process through which you physically separate outside text from you own. You can and should take similar precautions with your code, never mingling outside code with your work unless you've properly cited it.

4) Comment Your Code Thoroughly

    > Every programming language as a means of inserting comments into code and thoroughly commenting code is a good practice every programmer should follow. However, it is doubly important when incorporating outside code into your work, as comments are a simple way to illustrate what is and is not original. It's also useful if your instructors have any question about whether you wrote the code as good comments can illustrate a thorough understanding of what was written.

5) Use Original Variable Names

    > Then possible, ensure that your variable, class and other names are original. To be clear, simply changing variable names on copied code does NOT make it original but having unique and meaningful variable names not only makes coding easier for you, but also highlights that the work is yours.

6) Commit Often

    > It is expected that you make frequent and meaningful git commits throughout the entirety of your assignments. We expect that you have a minimum of 10 commits per assignment, that those commits are made progressively between the assigned day and the due date, and that each commit represents a proportional contribution to what will be your final submission.

    > Simply stated - we will not accept work that is composed of one commit representing the entirety of submission.

### Plagiarism on Homework

#### First Strike

> The student will have a private conversation with both the instructional team and SSM to walk through their assignment and to discuss the Academic Honesty Policy.

> Student has the option for this to be an assignment they do not complete. Assignment marked as “Incomplete” in BCS.

> The student is offered the opportunity to resubmit the assignment following the SOP (How to Avoid Plagiarism), with 100% their own original work within one week.

> They will receive a grade no greater than a B.

#### Second Strike

> The student is asked to walk through the assignment and is again reminded of the Academic Honesty policy.

> The assignment is graded as "F" and a final warning is given to the student.

#### Third Strike

> The student’s case is escalated to the university level and additional action regarding any official investigation or university practice will be initiated. This could result in the expulsion of the student.
