## Plagiarism

[Back to Course Guidelines](/../../)

We want you to get the most out of your Coding Bootcamp. You must put your best individual effort into all course deliverables, including assignments, activities, projects, and any additional submissions. These materials will showcase your work and capabilities as you enter the job search.

We understand that sometimes life happens or certain coursework poses more of a challenge. However, you must push through these challenges and **submit your own work**. Not only is doing so more ethical but it also ensures you're learning the material, mastering each topic, and keeping pace with the class.

### Support

We're here to support you! If you're struggling, inform your instructor, TAs, or SSM as soon as possible. We'll work with you to get you back on track. Attend office hours, sign up for tutoring, join a study group, and work with your team. You can always ask your SSM for additional support.

### Tutoring

You can request tutoring by going to the Support tab in the upper right-hand side of BCS. When you click Support, a form will come up, with a specific category for Tutor Requests. Under the "What can we help you with?" question, include your GitHub username and any topics you'd like to cover with your tutor.

### What is Plagiarism in the Coding Industry?

The best part about GitHub and web development itself is that it's open source. Developers share their discoveries and new practices, which others then adopt. You can post issues and questions in Stack Overflow and have another developer send you corrected code, explaining where the problem was.

Plagiarism is taking another individuals code and portraying it as your own. Stealing someone’s repository, and or copying and pasting entire repositories, or even large snippets of code without stemming from your own is also plagiarism.

Plagiarism includes the following:

* Copying and pasting entire application code

* Matching another developer’s solution to a coding challenge exactly or almost exactly

* Copying front-end design with minimal changes

* Reusing partial code but not changing variables, comments, and structure to match individual application

**Reusing smaller code snippets is not plagiarism.**

### Plagiarism vs. Collaboration

Instead of resorting to plagiarism, you can use code **snippets** from places like StackOverflow or GitHub. You can also get help from others, especially other students. But when you seek outside help, you must meet these conditions:

* You can understand the code.

* The author of the code allows you to use that code openly.

* You cite the source as a comment for your instructional staff to review for approval.

**Note:** We don't encourage the use of others' code. You should only implement this strategy to maintain engament and momentum in your coding practice. Please follow these additional guidelines:

**Pseudocode Together—Plan Your Attack in Non-Code Terms**

Pseudocode is an informal, high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm. It's intended for human reading rather than machine reading. Pseudocode typically omits details that are essential for machine understanding of the algorithm, such as variable declarations, system-specific code, and some subroutines.

**Type Every Line of Code Yourself**

We expect you to type every line of code. We expect you, if asked, to articulate the reasoning, benefits, drawbacks, and experimentation failures and successes to the choices you made and the way you expressed those choices in code.

Treat examples posted online as tools for learning, not as simple fixes. You should attempt to understand each example in context&mdash;as it applies to your situation&mdash;then digest the takeaways and apply those lessons to your needs.

**Code in a Cleanroom**

Writing in a cleanroom means physically separating outside text from your own, so that you never forget to cite someone else's work. Take similar precautions with your code: never mingle outside code with yours unless you've properly cited it.

**Comment Your Code Thoroughly**

Every programming language allows you to insert comments into code. Thoroughly commenting code is a good practice for every programmer and is doubly important when incorporating outside code; comments allow you to illustrate what is and isn't original. Comments can also demonstrate your understanding of the code, answering any questions your instructors may have about whether you wrote it.

**Use Original Variable Names**

When possible, use original variable, class, and other names. Simply changing variable names on copied code does NOT make it original. Using unique and meaningful variable names not only makes coding easier for you but also highlights your original work.

**Commit Often**

We expect you to make frequent and meaningful git commits throughout all your assignments. We expect a minimum of 10 commits per assignment, made progressively between the assigned day and the due date, with each commit representing a proportional contribution to your final submission.

We will not accept work composed of one commit representing the entirety of submission.

### Plagiarism on Homework

#### First Strike

The student will have a private conversation with both the instructional team and the SSM to walk through their assignment and discuss the Academic Honesty Policy.

The student may accept a mark of Incomplete for this assignment.

The student may resubmit the assignment in line with our guidelines on avoiding plagiarism, with 100% original work, within one week. The student will receive a grade no greater than a B on the assignment.

#### Second Strike

The student must walk through the assignment and review the Academic Honesty Policy again.

The assignment will receive an F, and the student will receive a final warning.

#### Third Strike

We'll escalate the student’s case to the university level, initiating additional action such as an official investigation or university practice. This could result in the student's expulsion.
