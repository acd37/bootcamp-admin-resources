# Student Code of Conduct

[Back to Course Guidelines](/../../)

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members of a classroom community pledge to make participation in our projects and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Behavior that contributes to a positive environment
includes:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language

-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

-   Focusing on what's best for the community

-   Showing empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behavior includes:

-   Using sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances

-   Trolling, making insulting or derogatory comments, and making personal or political attacks

-   Harrassing someone in public or private

-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

-   Engaging in other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both in classroom spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the classroom community for homework, course review, or project work.

## Enforcement

You may report instances of abuse, harassment, or otherwise unacceptable behavior by contacting your SSM, TAs, or instructor. We will review and investigate all complaints and will offer a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
