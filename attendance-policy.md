## Attendance

[Back to Course Guidelines](/../../)

Students must maintain **95% attendance**.

Absences permitted: **4 classes**.
Remote sesions permitted: **4 classes** with _prior approval_.

Students attending remotely must do the following:

-  Request remote attendance 30 minutes before the start of class.

-  Consistently interact with TAs on Slack throughout class.

-  If possible, collaborate with other students attending remotely.

-  Complete all classroom activities before class end.

This program should be an in-person, collaborative learning experience. We expect students to attend all class sessions.

Remote session attendance shouldn't replace in-person attendance. Instead, it should serve as an alternative for students in _extreme circumstances_ who don't have the option to attend class but wish to stay on track as much as possible.

Remote attendance during project weeks isn't permitted, as students must participate in and complete 100% of project work to meet graduation criteria.

## Late Arrival or Early Departure Policy

3 late arrivals or 3 early departures add up to a single absence.

A late arrival or early departure means arriving more than 10 minutes late or leaving more than 10 minutes early from a session.

Students should try to arrive 5 minutes before the start of class.
