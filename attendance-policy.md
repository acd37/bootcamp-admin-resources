## Attendance

[Back to Course Guidelines](/../../)

Attendance must be maintained at a **95%** rate.

Absences permitted: **4 classes**.
Remote sesions permitted: **4 classes** with _prior approval_.

Expectations for remote class:

-   Request remote attendance 30 minutes prior to the start of class.

-   Consistent interaction with TAs on Slack throughout the durations of class time.

-   Possible collaboration with other students if they, too, are attending remote.

-   Completion of all classroom activities prior to class end.

This program is designed to be an in-person, collaborative learning experience and the expectation remains for students to be in class for all sessions.

Remote session attendance (4 max) is being provided as an exception for students with _extreme circumstances_, where in-person attendance is not an option, but students wish to stay on track as much as possible. This allowance is not meant to replace being in the classroom.

Remote attendance during project is not permitted as students are required to complete 100% of project work and project participation is required to meet graduation criteria.

## Late/Early-departure Policy

3 Lates or 3 Early-departures adds up to a single absence.

A Late or Early-departure is classified as arriving more than 10 minutes late or leaving more than 10 minutes early from a session.

It is recomended that sudents arrive 5 minutes prior to the start of class.
